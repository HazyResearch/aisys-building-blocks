# Building Blocks for Foundation Models

This is a (biased) view of great work studying the building blocks of foundation models.
This Github was originally put together as a place to aggregate materials for a [NeurIPS keynote](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/invited-talk/73990) - but we're also hoping to highlight great work across ML Systems.
If you think we're missing something, please open an issue or PR!
